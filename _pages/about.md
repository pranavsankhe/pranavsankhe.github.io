I am a final year PhD student at [CSE](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/phd-candidates.html) department of [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu) jointly supervised by [Dr. Varun Chandola](https://ubdsgroup.github.io/team/varun-chandola/) and [Dr. Kenneth Joseph](https://kennyjoseph.github.io). During my graduate studies, I joined [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/publications/tablecnn-deep-learning-framework-for-learning-tabular-data) as a research intern and [ByteDance Research](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) as gradute researcher. I completed undergraduate studies at [University of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in), where I received a B.E. in Computer Engineering.

My current research interest revolves around `causal machine learning` and its applications in social sciences and medicine. In the past, I have worked on `3D computer vision problems` and `language models` leaveraging advances in `machine learning` and `deep learning`.
